 * Sequential System Exclusive data is arranged in 8-byte packets.  The first
 * byte in each packet is a composite of the high bits of the next seven data
 * bytes.
 *
 * Four functions are provided in this header:
 *
 * Seq_unpack() converts a single Sequential system exclusive dump values 
 * into a series of data bytes, so that the values may be freely manipulated
 *
 * Seq_pack() converts an array of Sequential data into the packed format,
 * so that it may be transmitted via system exclusive to the appropriate
 * synth.
 *
 * Seq_set() is a shortcut for putting a value array into a SequentialData
 * struct, given its size and the value array.
 *
 * Seq_dump() sends the values to standard output.

 *
 *   (Accept a system exclusive dump.  Process the sysex header yourself, and

 *    the value array in int size)

/*
 * Given unpacked data (for example, data that might be modified or created by
 * calling software), Seq_pack() returns a PackedData, whose data contains 
 * a packed representation of the data.  The PackedData is suitable for sending 
 * back to a Sequential instrument.  To send the packed data back via a file or 
 * direct I/O call, see Seq_dump(); or roll your own I/O to MIDI.  Don't forget
 * the appropriate system exclusive header.
 * 
 * Example:
 *
 *   (Let's continue the example from Seq_unpack() by opening the filter all 
 *    the way. As you may recall, mopho_voice_data is an UnpackedData)
 *   mopho_voice.value[20] = 164;
